packet payload size: 1400 bytes
delay between each packet sent: 800 ns
average throughput with minimal packet lost: 1.5 Mbytes/s

note:
- should be enought for 12 Mbit/s video
- 16 lost per sec
- MCS 2,3,4 does not change throughput (?!)

svpcom rtl8812au driver patch, is speed optimized (*)
Legacy drops very few packets up to 0x6c (54 Mb/s)
MCS drops few packets up to index 6 (58,5 Mb/s)

aircrack rtl8812au driver patch, is less speed optimized than svpcom.
Legacy drops are equivalent for 0x30 (24 Mb/s)
MCS drops are equivalent for index in range 2,3,4. 
No packets are received for Legacy above 0x60 (48 Mb/s) or MCS above 5 (52 Mb/s)

If no extra speed is needed, aircrack versions can be used for kernel version 5 and 6
waiting for svpcom to commit optimization patch in aircrack ;-)
