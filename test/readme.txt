 *
 * For political reasons, IP wasn't allocated a global so-called SAP number,
 * which means that a simple LLC header is not enough to indicate that an IP
 * frame was sent. 802.2 does, however, allow EtherType types (the same kind of
 * type numbers used in, you guessed it, Ethernet) through the use of the
 * "Subnetwork Access Protocol", or SNAP. To use SNAP, the three bytes in the
 * LLC have to be set to the magical numbers 0xAA 0xAA 0x03. The next five bytes
 * are then interpreted as a SNAP header. To specify an EtherType, we need to
 * set the first three of them to 0. The last two bytes can then finally be set
 * to 0x0800, which is the IP EtherType.
